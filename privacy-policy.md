# Privacy Policy

LidHeight takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy LidHeight provides this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

LidHeight requires access to the camera on users' mobile devices. LidHeight does not require their users to create or have an account to use the application. From this LidHeight gathers no information on the user. The application uses depth-sensing capabilities in the mobile camera to calculate and display the palpebral fissure height and pupillary distance of the user. There are no user accounts. 


## Data Use and Sharing

As previously stated above, LidHeight does not store their users data beyond real time application. In addition, LidHeight does not work with any third party sources whatsoever. This includes distribution of user data for marketing, advertising or user-based data mining, including by third parties. No personal data of users is collected or stored. No derivative data is stored or collected. Third party affiliations do no exist in any form; there is no sharing of data in any form.


## Security

We understand personal information is important to our user base. That is why we do not store any data whatsoever. Once your palpebral fissure height is calculated the data is lost forever. Unfortunately, if the user denies LidHeight access to their camera this will eliminate all functionality of the application. 


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 23rd, 2020 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
